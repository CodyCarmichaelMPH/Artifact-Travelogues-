# Artifact-Travelogues-
This project documents the movement of ancient artifacts throughout time and makes it available for public access. This project uses very basic HTML and CSS, so it is beginner and non-programmer friendly. Contributors who are more comfortable with code are encouraged to make edits and suggestions to improve the format.  

## Organization 
Each folder will be named after an artifact. Each folder will eventually contain four files:
1. nameofartifact.html
2. nameofartifact.css
3. firstthreelettersofartifactname-sourcesheet.md
4. artifactname.jpeg 


## Activities
* Create new file folders for any artifacts that you think are worth researching. 
* Find and upload images files to the respective folders.
* Contribute information about the history of the artifact's movement. 
* Proofread and update information.

# How to make edits 

## Forking and Pull Requests:
* Fork the Repository to work on your own local copy. 
* After making your edits, create a pull request to push your changes to the original repository for Artifact-Travelogues 

## Creating a new artifact folder (for those who are new to Github) 
* Press the Add file button. Select the option to create a new file. 
* Fill in the Name your file option by typing in the artifact's name. The artifacts name must end with a forward slash '/'.
* You have created a new file! In order to save your changes, you must create a file to be stored in the folder. Fill in the Name your file textbox with a filename. For example, nameofartifact.html. 
* Scroll to the bottom of the page to the Commit new file box. Select the option to 'Commit to main branch.'
* On your local repository, go to Pull Requests and select rhe Create new pull request button.
* Add a description indicating the changes you made. 
* When you are satisfied, click the button to Create pull request.


## Rules for adding and editing files
* See Organization for the appropriate file names and types for each folder. 
* Use template.html and template.css to create your html and css files. You can copy and paste the code into the new files. However, if you are more experienced in coding and can suggest a better layout, please feel free to submit a pull request! 
* You must upload a jpeg file of the artifact to its respective folder. Otherwise, the embeded image will not work in the html file.


## Research tips
1. For good quality images, try Google Arts and Culture and museum websites.
2. Look for the *who, what, where and when.* For instance, take note of who (person or institution) owned the artifact, where it was located and for what period of time it was held in that place.
3. Use websites and other accessible online sources.

## Documenting external sources 
* Citations will be tracked on the markdown sheet in each folder. 
* Use this format to track sources: 

1. *Quoted fact from html file* <br>
       (https://www.history.com/)
