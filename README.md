# Artifact-Travelogues-
This project documents the movement of museum artifacts throughout time and makes it available for public access. 

## Organization 
Each folder will be named after an artifact. Each folder must contain four files:
1. nameofartifact.html
2. nameofartifact.css

## Activities
* Create new file folders for any artifacts that you think are worth researching. 
* Find and upload images files to the respective folders.
* Contribute information about the history of the artifact's movement. 
* Proofread and update information.

# How to make edits

## Research tips
1. For good quality images, try Google Arts and Culture and museum websites.
2. Look for the *who, what, where and when.* For instance, take note of who (person or institution) owned the artifact, where it was located and for what period of time. 

## Documenting external sources 
It's crucial to identify where your facts come from. The citation guide is the Chicago Manual of Style (17th edition)
