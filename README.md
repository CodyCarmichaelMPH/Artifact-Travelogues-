# Artifact-Travalogues-
This project documents the movement of museum artifacts throughout time and makes it available for public access. 

## Theoretical aims 
To reflect on ownership, power, and history. 

## Organization 
Each folder will be named after an artifact. Each folder will contain two different files:
1. jpeg 
2. html 

The jpeg file will be the image of the artifact. The html file is where you will upload research and document your sources.

## For contributors
1. Create new file folders for any artifacts that you think are worth researching. 
2. Uploading images files to the respective folders.
3. Contribute information about the history of the artifact's movement. 

## Research tips
1. For good quality images, try Google Arts and Culture and museum websites.
2. Look for the *who, what, where and when.* For instance, take note of who (person or institution) owned the artifact, where it was located and for what period of time? 

## Documenting external sources 
Documenting sources on this project is simple. There is no need to use any style guide, but it is important to identify where your facts came from. <will insert an example of the format via an image>
