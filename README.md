## Adding and editing files




## Research tips
1. For good quality images, try Google Arts and Culture and museum websites.
2. Look for the *who, what, where and when.* For instance, take note of who (person or institution) owned the artifact, where it was located and for what period of time. 

## Documenting external sources 
It's crucial to identify where your facts come from. The citation guide is the Chicago Manual of Style (17th edition)
