# Artifact-Travalogues-
This project documents the movement of museum artifacts throughout time and makes it available for public access. 

## Theoretical aims of the project 
To reflect on ownership, power, and history. 

## What you will be contributing

1. Create new file folders for any artifacts that you think are worth researching. 
2. Uploading images to the respective folders.
3. Contribute information about the history of the artifact's movement. 

## What to look for while researching 
1. For good quality images, try Google Arts and Culture and museum websites.
2. Look for the *who, what, where and when.* For instance, take note of who (person or institution) owned the artifact, where it was located and for what period of time.
